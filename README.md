This repository contains my project proposal for SavePaws Club.  
The idea is to build a website/app that focuses on animal rescue, protection, and welfare.  
I want to create a platform where people can immediately help injured or harassed animals, find treatment support, adopt or rehome pets, and connect with a strong community of animal lovers.
