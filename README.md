# SavePaws Club – Project Proposal

This repository contains my project proposal for SavePaws Club.  
The idea is to build a website/app that focuses on animal rescue, protection, and welfare.  
I want to create a platform where people can immediately help injured or harassed animals, find treatment support, adopt or rehome pets, and connect with a strong community of animal lovers.  

## Proposal Overview
Objective: Reduce animal harassment and provide real-time rescue and welfare solutions.  

Key Features:  
Emergency rescue system with both online and offline help.  
Veterinary information and treatment guidance.  
Pet adoption and rehoming system.  
Blogs, articles, and daily health tips.  
Report abuse and legal support.  
Marketplace for pet essentials.  
Community forum for animal lovers.  
Donation portal for trusted NGOs.  

Impact: Encourage responsible pet ownership, reduce stray suffering, and build a rescue-support network.  

Future Scope: GPS rescue vans, volunteer training, mobile app, and multi-language support.
